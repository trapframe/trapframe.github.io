As i intend to spend quite some time speaking about Windows kernel debugging here, i figured giving up a cool link would be a good start.

Since not anyone has a MSDN subscription at home, getting access to a bunch of free prebuilt Windows VMs is always a good news :)

You can get [here](http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads) a bunch of these prebuilt Windows VMs, ranging from XP to Windows 8 in various format (VirtualBox, VHD, VMware).

Go grab them !

This is very handy for testing and i use them as debugging targets.

I will soon start a serie of articles on Windows kernel debugging (beginners targeted), so this link might get usefull soon ...
